The modern high-rise setting in the heart of Alam Sutera creates a professional atmosphere that prepares you for the corporate world. From the state-of-the-art computer labs to the stunning city views, every corner of the campus inspires you to aim higher.",
          "campusContent2": "What makes SGU special is its intimate class sizes. Unlike massive lecture halls at other universities, our classes are small enough that professors know your name. This creates an environment where asking questions and engaging in discussions feels natural.",
          "jackTitle": "Jack of All Trades? Think Again.",
          "jackContent1": "When I first started at SGU, I had this nagging worry: \"Am I just scratching the surface of everything? Am I becoming a jack of all trades, master of none?\" The IT curriculum covers so much—web development, databases, networking, security, AI, mobile development, and more. It felt overwhelming at times.",
          "jackContent2": "But as I progressed through my studies, I had a revelation. Learning the breadth of technology isn't a weakness—it's a superpower. By understanding a little bit of everything, I gained something invaluable: perspective.",
          "jackContent3": "Now I can see how different pieces of technology connect. I understand why a backend developer needs to think about security, why a frontend developer should understand databases, and why everyone should know the basics of DevOps. This bird's-eye view helped me discover what truly excites me and where I want to go deeper.",

          "depthConclusion": "I wouldn't have discovered these interests if I hadn't been exposed to everything first. The \"jack of all trades\" approach wasn't spreading me thin—it was helping me find my direction.",
          "academicTitle": "The Academic Journey",
          "academicContent": "The IT curriculum at SGU is rigorous but rewarding. We don't just learn theory—we build things. From our first semester, we're writing code, building applications, and working on real-world projects. The professors, many of whom have industry experience, bring practical insights that textbooks simply can't provide.",

          "beyondContent1": "University life at SGU extends far beyond lectures and assignments. I've had the opportunity to participate in hackathons, tech workshops, and networking events.

          "lessonContent1": "If you're a student feeling overwhelmed by the breadth of what you're learning, here's my advice: embrace it. Don't worry about being a generalist at first. Use this time to explore, experiment, and discover what truly excites you. The depth will come naturally once you find your passion.",
          "lessonContent2": "SGU taught me that understanding the landscape of technology is just as important as mastering one specific area. Now, with that foundation, I know exactly where I want to dig deeper—and I have the context to understand how it all fits together."

I remember one web exploitation challenge where I had to chain multiple vulnerabilities together—SQL injection leading to file upload, then using that to achieve remote code execution. It required patience, persistence, and plenty of coffee.",
          "challengesContent2": "The cryptography challenges were particularly fun. There's something deeply satisfying about cracking an encrypted message and watching the plaintext emerge. Each solved challenge felt like unlocking a secret.",
